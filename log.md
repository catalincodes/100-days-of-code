# Catalin's 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed the work I have done back in February-March and wrote a documentation page for it in Notion.

**Thoughts** It felt very good to start coding again. Today there wasn't any actual code written. I spent the entire hour looking up how to make MySQL socket work and setting up Habbot and a local Habitica fork. Progress is progress though.

### Day 2: May 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I have looked at the JS file which I need to modify. Noticed that I need to make hard modifications to the DB if I don't want to wait until Sunday. Did a refresher on MySQL and tested on a bidon database running transactions on MySQL. 

**Thoughts** Documentation is seriously underrated. The documentation I wrote on Monday sped up my start-up time from 5 minutes to 20 seconds. I had all the commands, how many terminals, which URL to use to validate ALL WRITTEN DOWN. It made a huge difference.

### Day 3: May 20, Friday

**Today's progress**: I have executed the database script I wrote on Wednesday. Got it to work just fine, but I need to do more digging. 

**Thoughts**: Planning and analyzing helps. I definitely made some minimal progress. I will want to do some more work this weekend and close this user story.


### Day 4: May 22, Sunday

**Today's progress**: I have looked at the actual code and tried to do further analysis. I am done analyzing for now. I went ahead and wrote the new user story for the next step as outlined in the EPIC and I'm going to start modifying the current code next time.

**Thoughts**: I knew analyzing code would pay off. I found out that functionality that I'm supposed to replace is present in two scenarios. Removing one does not prevent the other use case from executing the same kind of code. I will have to discuss the discoveries with the PO.

### Day 4: February 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
* Set up SSH/GPG/GH CLI
* Clone Repo
* Set Up IDE and fix .gitignore file
* Install PostGreSQL
* Set Up DB
* Look into what is required to make bot work

**Thoughts**: I will need to set up a Discord bot and ideally connect it to 2 servers, not just one. The code needs to be adapted as Discord.Py changed a lot.
