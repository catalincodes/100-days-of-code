##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed the work I have done back in February-March and wrote a documentation page for it in Notion.

**Thoughts** It felt very good to start coding again. Today there wasn't any actual code written. I spent the entire hour looking up how to make MySQL socket work and setting up Habbot and a local Habitica fork. Progress is progress though.

### Day 2: May 18, Wednesday

** Today's Progress**: I have looked at the JS file which I need to modify. Noticed that I need to make hard modifications to the DB if I don't want to wait until Sunday. Did a refresher on MySQL and tested on a bidon database running transactions on MySQL. 

**Thoughts** Documentation is seriously underrated. The documentation I wrote on Monday sped up my start-up time from 5 minutes to 20 seconds. I had all the commands, how many terminals, which URL to use to validate ALL WRITTEN DOWN. It made a huge difference.
