# Rules of Catalin's 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour for 100 days and log them.*

#### Start Date
May 16, 2022.

## Additional Rules
1. I will log in the FCC Discord Server/Guild about my progress every day that I code -> using the emoji :100:
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I can't miss out more than 1 consecutive day. Exceptions like when I go on vacation or such are fine, but regular days I need to do this EVERY day or EVERY OTHER day.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. Time spent on tutorials only counts if I'm coding whatever the tutorial covers on my own at the same time.
6. Any development activity counts: coding, research for bugs, reading relevant code, debugging, testing things, etc.

## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/)
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
5. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
